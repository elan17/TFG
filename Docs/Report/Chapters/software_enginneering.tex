\chapter{Application development}

Before starting to code an application, the process has to be planned beforehand to guarantee that the project will be successful. Every different software project has different
characteristics that influence the decision on the methodology that should be followed.
Technologies, procedures, testing, time schedules, client meetings... All of
them must be taken into account to prevent extra work, bad quality software or
client dissatisfaction. In this chapter, we present the steps followed to design, construct and test an application to assist a designer to search for new binary sequences under certain requirements and to check their properties. Most of the information is mostly based on  \citet{Sommerville} and highly inspired in \citet{Mario_diaz}.
