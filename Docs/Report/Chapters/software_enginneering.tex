\chapter{Software Engineering}

Before starting to develop our software blindly, a good engineer has to plan
beforehand how the proccess will be. Every different project have different
characteristics that influence the methodology that should be taken.
Technologies, procedures, testing, time schedules, client meetings. All of
them must be taken into account to prevent extra work, bad quality software or
client dissatisfaction. In this chapter, most of the information is taken
directly from \citet{Sommerville}.
