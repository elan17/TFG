The generation of families of sequences with a bounded correlation, among other
properties, is of interest in several fields such as cryptography,
wireless communications and digital watermarks. Commercial applications such as
GPS or military uses such as Radar have been developed and improved thanks to
the search of these sequences and the analysis of their autocorrelation function
and the correlation between members of the same family.\\

In this project, we focus on a technique for the algebraic construction of
sequences where a sequence of shifts and a sequence with good
properties generate a new sequence. The aim is the exhaustive
search of longer sequences then the ones already present in the literature.
To do so, a software intended to provide support to a designer  has been developed to assist in the search of said
sequences and check their properties, which can be deployed in a supercomputer. The applications of these sequences
are, among others, radars and location systems with higher spatial resolution.
