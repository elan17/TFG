The generation of families of sequences with a bounded correlation among other
properties is of interest in several fields such as cyptography,
wireless comunications and digital watermarks. Commercial application such as
GPS or military uses such as radar have been developed and improved thanks to
the search of these sequences by the research on their autocorrelation function
and the correlation between members of the same family.\\

In this project, we focus on a technique for the algebraic contruction of
sequences where, through a sequence of shitfs and a sequence with good
properties, a new sequence is generated. The objective is the exhaustive
search of longer sequences that the ones already shown in the literature.
To do so, a support software for the designer has been developed with the
ability to be deployed in a supercomputer to assist in the search of said
sequences and in checking their properties. The applications of this sequences
are, among others, radars and location systems with higher spatial and temporal
resolution.
