The analisis of the correlation of signals is a key piece in several
engineering developments such as the GPS, the radar or the correction of errors
during information transmission. Having shaped so many diverse activities like
driving, cartography or internet usage, the study of the correlation function
may lead to new developments or improvements in the ones that already exist.\\

In this project, we focus on the generation of new pseudorandom sequences for
more accurate radars or GPS technologies. To do so, a new software, deployable
in a supercomputer, has been developed to assist in the search of these
sequences.
