The analisis of the correlation of signals it's a key piece in several
engineering developments such as GPS, sonar or the correction of errors at
information transmission. Having shaped so many diverse activities like
driving, cartography or internet usage, the study of the correlation function
may lead to new developments or improvements in the ones that already exist.\\

In this project, we focus on the generation of new pseudorandom sequences for
more accurate sonar or GPS technologies. To do so, a new software deployable in
a new supercomputer has been developed to assist in the search of those
sequences.
