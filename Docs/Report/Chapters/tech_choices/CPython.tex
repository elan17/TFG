\section{CPython}

Python\footnote{https://python.org/} programming language is one of the most used
languages in scientific enviroments, as well as in system integration developments.\\

In our case, the usage of Python serves 2 different purposes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It is the language the researchers are the most familiar with. This
  helps the project to be extended according to the user needs when it is finished.
  \item It is a language widely used. This means that support can be expected
  from a lot of platforms while having a high-quality bunch of libraries to work
  with.
\end{itemize}


In addition, the developer has a solid experience with the stack of
technologies around Python which shouldn't be understated. Furthermore, their
expertise in the language let's them explore more new concepts in the same time
such as MPI or the whole domain knowledge needed for this project.\\
