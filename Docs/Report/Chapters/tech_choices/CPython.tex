\section{CPython}

Python\cite{Python} programming language is one of the most used languages
in scientific enviroments, as well as in system integration developments.\\

In our case, the usage of Python serves 2 different purposes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It's the language the researchers are the most familiar with. This
  helps the project because when the project is finished, they can extend the
  software for their needs as they want.
  \item It's a language widely used. This means that we can expect support from
  a lot of platforms while having a high-quality bunch of libraries to work
  wih.
\end{itemize}


In addition, the developer has a solid experience with the stack of
technologies around Python which shouldn't be understated. Furthermore, his
profiency in the language let's him explore more new concepts in the same time
such as MPI or the whole domain knowledge needed for this project.\\
