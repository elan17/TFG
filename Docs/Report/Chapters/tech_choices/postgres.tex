\section{PostgreSQL}

PostgreSQL\cite{postgres} is an open-source relational database supported in
a highly varied range of enviroments. As such we don't depend on a particular
Linux distribution to deploy(For example, Oracle only supports RedHat).\\

Even if the database isn't as fast as Oracle or other databases, our
application isn't constraint by IO(as the generation of values to store in the
database depends directly in a costly computation). In our case, we would
want a persistence system that supports well our stack of technologies. As
PostgreSQL is designed to run python code on it's SQL code, it gives us a lot
flexibility in how we want to design our application.
