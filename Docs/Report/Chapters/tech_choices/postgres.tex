\section{PostgreSQL}

PostgreSQL\footnote{https://postgresql.org/} is an open-source relational
database supported in a highly varied range of enviroments. As such, there is no
dependency on a particular Linux distribution to deploy (for example, Oracle only
supports RedHat).\\

Even if the database isn't as fast as Oracle or other databases, our
application isn't constraint by IO (as the generation of values to store in the
database depends directly in a costly computation). In our case, a persistence
system that supports well our stack of technologies is preferred. As
PostgreSQL is designed to run Python code on it's SQL code, it gives a lot
of flexibility in how our application can be designed.
