\section{SageMath}

SageMath\cite{Sage} is a Python mathematical suite used in research projects as
an enviroment for prototyping algorythms or math concepts in general.\\

In our case, it served as a junction point between a mathematician that is used
to express ideas in math expressions and a developer that is used to
understanding concepts by making them work. Apart from that, it was also
useful at generating some figures for this document.\\

For our use case, a way to share the notebooks through the cloud was needed.
We decided to work with a free version of CoCalc\cite{cocalc}. Even though it
served the purpose of sharing code without the need of using a repository,
I have to say that in terms of other services such as running the notebooks
was very dissapointing. For low demanding tasks it performs well, but for
bigger computations I had to copy the code and run it locally. In future
projects, I might try out the payed version (as it has tons of features)
or other alternatives.\\
