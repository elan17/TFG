\section{Maximum Length Sequence(MLS)}

MLS are an exponential binary PRN construction that was initially concived
using linear feedback shift registers(LFSR). The particular type of LFSR used
in MLS can be simulated with extensions of binary Finite Fields. The
definitions are:

\begin{definition}[LFSR]
  A MLS is a binary sequence generated by an LFSR that, given an initial state
  different from 0, it cycles between all posible states except 0.
\end{definition}

Which, as shown in \citet{golomb_ref}, is equivalent to:

\begin{definition}[Finite Fields]
  Given $E/GF(2)$, $\alpha$ a primitive element of $E$ and $S$ the resulting
  sequence:
  \begin{equation}
    S_{i} = trace(\alpha^{i})
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{property}
  A MLS will always be of length of the form $2^{n}-1$ where n is an arbitrary
  natural number.
\end{property}

\begin{property}
  A MLS sequence will always have an autocorrelation function such as all the
  components will be -1 except when $\tau = 0$
\end{property}

Notice that, even though the construction is exponential, the complexity of
the algorithm is $O(n)$ when $n$ is the size of the sequence. The problem is
that we might need sequences of arbitrary size in some applications. As we will
see in a following chapter, the complexity of computing the autocorrelation
with the fourier transform approach is $O(n*log(n))$ so using longer sequences
than needed has a direct impact on the performance of the system. \\

This sequences by themselfs might not a be huge deal because they don't define
a way to build families of well crosscorrelated sequences but they are the
building blocks for other contructions such as the Gold Codes used in GPS and
CDMA.
