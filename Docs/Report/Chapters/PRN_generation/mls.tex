\section{Maximum Length Sequence(MLS)}

MLS are a exponential binary PRN construction that uses linear
feedback shift registers(LFSR) with particular properties.

\begin{property}
  A MLS will always be of length of the form $2^{n}-1$ where n is an arbitrary
  natural number.
\end{property}

\begin{property}
  The polynomial over GF(2) representing the LFSR must be primitive or,
  in other words, the LFSR must have a period such that it reaches all posible
  states except all zeros before repeating itself.
\end{property}
