\section{Gold Codes}

Gold codes are a family of sequences derived from MLS with so
important properties that are used in several applications such as wireless
communication and geolocalisation. A Gold Code generator gets two MLS sequences
that fulfill:

\begin{property}
  Given two MLS that can generate Gold Codes, $S1$ and $S2$, of length $2^{n}-
  1$, $CC$ the crosscorrelation function defined in Equation \ref{eq:7}:
    \begin{equation}
      max |CC(S1, S2)| \leq 2^{\frac{n+2}{2}}
    \end{equation}
\end{property}

And XORs all their relative shifts generating a family of $2^{n} + 1$ sequences
($2^{n} - 1$ XORed sequences + 2 MLS sequences).

\begin{property}
  Given any two sequences, S1 and S2, from a Gold family of sequences of length
  $2^{n}-1$, $CC$ the crosscorrelation function defined in Equation \ref{eq:7}:
  \begin{equation}
        max |CC(S1, S2)| \leq \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
            2^{\frac{n+2}{2}}+1 & \textnormal{ if n is even } \\
            2^{\frac{n+1}{2}}+1 & \textnormal{if n is odd } \\
        \end{array}\right.
  \end{equation}
\end{property}

% TODO: Add a  code example

This property means that the crosscorrelation between any given pair of
sequences from a Gold family is low enough to differentiate them. This proves
useful when several devices are transmiting in the same frecuency and we must
treat signals that are not the one we want to receive as noise.\\

Notice that this construction has the same problem as MLS sequences. It's
an exponential contruction so it might be not enough for some applications.
