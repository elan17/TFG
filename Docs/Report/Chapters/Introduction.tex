There is no doubt that signals have changed drastically the way we live.
Physical maps have passed out long ago in favor of real-time position tracking
systems. Who needs a meter when you can send a signal to measure distances
accuratly? Even publishing this project it's thanks to the hard work of
engineers that squeeze the capabilities of the carrier wave to transport
information throughout Internet. \\

In this chapter, we will introduce the correlation, autocorrelation and
crosscorrelation functions and it's mathematical properties. We will also take
a look at pseudorandom noise, it's properties and practical applications.
