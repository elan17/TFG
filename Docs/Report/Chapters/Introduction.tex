There is no doubt that signals have changed drastically the way we live.
Physical maps have lost relevance long ago in favor of real-time position
tracking systems. Who needs a physical meter when you can send a signal to
measure distances accuratly?  Thanks to the hard work of engineers that squeeze
the capabilities of the carrier wave to transport information throughout รง
Internet, we can even publish this document. 

In this chapter, we will introduce the correlation, autocorrelation and
crosscorrelation functions for periodic binary sequences and it's mathematical
properties. We will also take a look at pseudorandom noise, it's properties and
practical applications.
