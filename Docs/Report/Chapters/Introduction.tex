There is no doubt that signals have changed drastically the way we live.
Physical maps have passed out long ago in favor of real-time position tracking
systems. Who needs a meter when you can cast a signal to measure distances
accuratly? Even publishing this project it's thanks to the hard work of
engineers that squeeze the capabilities of the carrier wave to transport
information throughout Internet. \\

In this chapter, we will introduce the correlation, autocorrelation and
crosscorrelation functions, taking a look at it's applications in signal
proccesing and it's mathematical properties as well as the particular approach
from our research project.
