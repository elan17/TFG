Advances in wireless comunication and signal proccesing have drastically
changed the capabilities of transmitting information. Several wireless
networks can operate in the same channel thanks to technologies like
CDMA. Similarly, GPS\cite{GPS} satellites using direct-sequence spread
spectrum(DSSS) can broadcast their information to provide it's service. Long
distances can be measured with the help of radar technologies. This
technology depends on analyzing the eco of a sent signal to calculate the
distance to a target.\\

For several developments on signal proccesing, sequences with good properties
of crosscorrelation and autocorrelation function are needed to work. To keep
things simple and just for ilustration purposes, we are going to focus in just
two technologies through this document: spread-spectrum and radar.\\

The direct-sequence spread spectrum technology\cite{DSSS_1}\cite{DSSS} is
designed to fraction a given frecuency band between multiple transmissions. To
do so, DSSS designs a set of spreading sequences designed to appear noise to
other receptors. In other words, a set of pseudonoise sequences with low peak
crosscorrelations between them. A spreading sequence from this set is pre-
shared between emisor and receptor. Then, the receiver correlates the received
sequence with a synchronized version of the preshared sequence. If it founds a
peak in this correlation, the received sequence is processed. Otherwise, it's
detected as noise and discarded. This method limits greatly the bandwith of
each individual transmission but avoids time division and improves security to
jamming. This system is suitable to be used in applications with low volume
of information transmision but with several emitter such as GPS. In GPS,
satellites broadcast their current position and timestamp and from that
the distance to the sattelite can be computed. Having the signal of some more,
the position of the receiver can be triangulated.\\

A radar (radio detection and ranging) uses a radio-frequency electromagnetic
signal reflected from a target to determine properties such as position, speed,
etc. There are several versions of it but the ones interesting for this
project are PRN-based radars\cite{prn_radar_example1}\cite{prn_radar_example2}.
These radars exploit the characteristics of pseudonoise sequences to compute the
round trip time of the sent signal using the autocorrelation function. When
the signal returns to the receiver, the correlation between the original
signal and the received one will have a correlation spike.\\

In this chapter, the auto and crosscorrelation function for
periodic binary sequences and its mathematical properties will be introduced
as well as pseudorandom sequences, its properties and practical applications.
