\chapter{Future work}

  Even though we have a working prototype that can perform the algorythm,
  there's still a lot of work to be done:\\

  First of all, the persistency part of the program needs a complete rewrite.
  Nowadays, the search results are dumped in plain text files and have no
  kind of advanced queries or a way to store sequence properties.\\

  The program has a design limitation on the diversity of base sequences
  that can be used for the computation. It would be interesting to be capable
  of using different kinds from Legendre sequences. This leads us to the topic
  of a whole refactor of the code if Domingo wants to publish it as part as
  the research project he is doing. Some parts can be written more clearly
  and the MPI usage isn't the most efficient one. For example, all the tasks
  are assigned unbuffered which means that the interconnection network delay
  hasn't been mitigated at all.\\

  Apart from that, the program haven't been tested in a production enviroment.
  Some incompatibility problems must be fixed between the development
  enviroment in which, among other things, OpenMPI was used rather than
  MPICH and I wasn't able to compile MPI4PY in the supercomputer(I have to
  say that I hadn't much time to do so because of limitations out of
  my control). Needless to say that this means we haven't extended the
  existing literature on the topic yet.\\

  To finish my contribution to Domingo's research, I need to develop a
  complexity analysis of the algorythm in a similar fashion to the previous
  works of exhaustive research. To do so, we need to run the code for a long
  time to gather enough data to estimate the said complexity.\\

  Last but not least, the UI needs some tweaking too. We should provide the
  possibility of storing the parameters in a configuration file as some of
  them will be shared between most of the tasks (for example, the number of
  processes used). I should also review if the program really needs a
  permissions system for the database. As its running in an isolated
  enviroment to perform the computation, no external user has access to the
  data unless it's uploaded to an external server through the VPN(which would
  be a terrible practice and it would be another different app).\\

  This seems like a really long lists of TODOs. Keep in mind that this
  Bachelor thesis is a part of a research project that isn't yet finished. I
  think I've accomplish the goals that my director had for this thesis.

\chapter{Conclusions}

  The final results of the project can be sumarized as:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item I have acquired enough knowledge of the problem domain
    to be capable of helping to the researchers in their software needs.
    \item I have extended my knowledge in parallel computing by learning a
    new paradigm (Message Passing Parallelism).
    \item I have learned new tools (Cython and MPI) to fulfill the
    project needs.
    \item I have adapted my knowledge in functional programming and its
    robustness to develop the tests for this software.
    \item I have applied my knowledge in algorithmic complexity to make
    rational decisions on which is the best approach to a problem.
    \item I have overcome the limitations imposed by the current health crisis
    by changing my project management methodology to an agile development.
    \item I have learned how to manage a huge volume of scientific literature
    to carry out a research.
    \item I have started to work with a supercomputer to be capable of
    deploying this software and get actual results.
  \end{itemize}

  To conclude this report, I would like to provide some final thougts:
  \begin{itemize}

    \item After dealing with Cython, I have to say that I encountered many
    problems with the compiler. The GIL checker detected GIL usages in pure C
    code. The fused types are very cryptic. If I had to do another project
    with similar characteristics, I would probably write the core modules in
    C++ (To be able to use templates) and use Cython to create the
    bindings for Python.

    \item I recognize that I should have done some test in the supercomputer
    before starting the software engineering to check the availability
    of tools and the services that the supercomputer provides by itself.

    \item Even though I said I would try to develop a portable solution, as
    far I can tell from what I've worked so far with Calderon, i think that
    wasn't a realistic objective as the programs and tools available in each
    supercomputer seem to vary a lot.

    \item I have to be more methodic in my usage of GIT. Luckly I didn't need
    to do a rollback because my commits were huge and some of them in unstable
    states.

  \end{itemize}
