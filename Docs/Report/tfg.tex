\chapter{Future work}

  Some work that must be still done is summarized in this chapter:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The persistency module must be written with PostgreSQL as we are
    currently dumping the results in plain-text files.
    \item MPI usage can be farther improved if needed, nowadays we don't
    buffer new tasks in the nodes so the delay of the interconnection
    network haven't been mitigated.
    \item Because of a lack of time, I couldn't use Calderon to get some
    benchmarks for the parallelism model. This is a shame as some statistics
    on the complexity of our approach are a must to publish our results.
    \item Even if Domingo decided to stick with Legendre sequences to keep the
    program simple, it would probably be interesting to explore other kinds of
    base sequences.
    \item I should try to refactor the code to be more compatible with
    different versions of MPI as MPI4PY support all but I had to tweak my code
    to work in Calderon as I had used OpenMPI in my development process.
    \item My code isn't portable as Python's command conventions aren't
    standard. In Archlinux (my own system), the commands are python and python2
    while Debian (Calderon's system) uses python3 and python. As my main
    code wraps mpiexec, this is a pain to deal with.
    \item It would probably be useful to support config files as some
    parameters.
    for the command are common to all computations.
    \item I will have to consider if I really have to create a way to interact
    with the tasks and handle some kind of permissions as supercomputers seem
    to handle that for me.
    \item I will have to tidy up the code if Domingo wants to publish it as
    part of his investigation. Even though it's commented and it's readable,
    there are some parts that should be rewritten and optimized.
    \item We haven't expanded the literature yet so, at this stage, there's
    still some computations to be made.
  \end{itemize}

  This seems like a really long lists of TODOs. Keep in mind that this
  Bachelor thesis is a part of a research project that isn't yet finished. I
  think I've accomplish the goals that my director had for this thesis.

\chapter{Conclusions}

  The final results of the project can be sumarized as:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item I have acquired enough knowledge of the problem domain
    to be capable of helping to the researchers in their software needs.
    \item I have extended my knowledge in parallel computing by learning a
    new paradigm (Message Passing Parallelism).
    \item I have learned new tools (Cython and MPI) to fulfill the
    project needs.
    \item I have adapted my knowledge in functional programming and its
    robustness to develop the tests for this software.
    \item I have applied my knowledge in algorithmic complexity to make
    rational decisions on which is the best approach to a problem.
    \item I have overcome the limitations imposed by the current health crisis
    by changing my project management methodology to an agile development.
    \item I have learned how to manage a huge volume of scientific literature
    to carry out a research.
    \item I have started to work with a supercomputer to be capable of
    deploying this software and get actual results.
  \end{itemize}

  To conclude this report, I would like to provide some final thougts:
  \begin{itemize}

    \item After dealing with Cython, I have to say that I encountered many
    problems with the compiler. The GIL checker detected GIL usages in pure C
    code. The fused types are very cryptic. If I had to do another project
    with similar characteristics, I would probably write the core modules in
    C++ (To be able to use templates) and use Cython to create the
    bindings for Python.

    \item I recognize that I should have done some test in the supercomputer
    before starting the software engineering to check the availability
    of tools and the services that the supercomputer provides by itself.

    \item Even though I said I would try to develop a portable solution, as
    far I can tell from what I've worked so far with Calderon, i think that
    wasn't a realistic objective as the programs and tools available in each
    supercomputer seem to vary a lot.

    \item I have to be more methodic in my usage of GIT. Luckly I didn't need
    to do a rollback because my commits were huge and some of them in unstable
    states.

  \end{itemize}
