\chapter{Conclusions and future work}

  In general, the objectives for this project were  accomplished. A first version of the software has been deployed in a supercomputer to be ready to use for research. The main objective  for this project was to learn how a project of scientific   computation must be developed in term of  needs, requirements and peculiarities.\\

  First, the most difficult task has been to understand
  the problem domain. This software, in contrast with other consulting
  projects, requires a high level of knowledge in the state of the art of scientific research to be
  able to grasp the semantics of the program. This adds a huge challenge to
  the software engineer to ensure the correctness of the results. I can affirm with confidence that
  two thirds of the time was spent in learning all the concepts that where
  going to be used later to gather all the software requisites and semantics.\\

  Apart from that, the deployment on a
  supercomputer needs a paradigm shift in program design. Shared-memory
  parallelism is no longer an option as we are working with several computers
  connected by a "slow" interconnection network. Instead, a message-passing
  based approach is preferred with its added complexities and new ways of
  structuring the program.\\

  As the program was supposed to be extendable in the future, I had to
  find a way to create a code as familiar for them as possible. This lead me to
  develop a Python program (for its extensibility and readability) with
  critical code written Cython to get a competent performance. Looking
  backwards, I think that using Cython instead of C++ was an error as the
  compiler gave me some troubles. If I have to participate in a similar project,
  I will probably write all critical code directly on C++ and use Cython as
  an easy way to create the bindings for my Python code.\\

 From a personal point of view,  one of the things I enjoyed the most of this project is how well a
  functional programming mindset adapts to this particular problem. Being
  used to the pureness and robustness of FP languages such as Haskell,
  code can be written more effectively by exporting their features to this
  project.  I have briefly worked with a supercomputer and got a grasp
  on how tasks are deployed. There is still a lot of work to be done and I
  should have started to work with it earlier to develop a program more
  compatible with its architecture as I did not expect to be so different from
  my development environment but... we learn from mistakes. \domingo{Yo no te recomendaria decir esto, puede afectar negativamente a la percepción del trabajo}\\


 Even though we have a working prototype, there is still a lot of work to be done:\\

  First of all, the persistency part of the program can be improved to acommodate advanced queries or a way to store sequence properties.
  Nowadays, the search results are dumped in plain text files.\\

  The program has to be extended to cope with the diversity of base sequences of using different kinds from Legendre sequences. Additionally, there is room for improvement in the MPI usage to allow buffer assign to the task  to reduce the interconnection network delay.  Further work has to be done for testing the program in a production environment\\

To contribute to the research on the area on binary sequences, we need to run the code for a long time to find candidate sequences, as it have seen in the introduction the length of the sequences is of the order of $85$.\\

  Last but not least, the UI is still open to improvement. We should provide the
  possibility of storing the parameters in a configuration file as some of
  them will be shared between most of the tasks (for example, the number of
  processes used).After deployment a  permissions system for the database must be implemented to allow multiple users. As it is  running in an isolated
  environment to perform the computation, no external user has access to the
  data unless it is uploaded to an external server through the VPN.\\
